<h1>Fish Sauce</h1>

<p>Fish sauce is a liquid condiment made from fish or krill that have been coated in salt and fermented for up to two years.[1][2]:234 It is widely used as a staple seasoning in East and Southeast Asian cuisine.

Following widespread recognition of its ability to impart a savory umami flavor to dishes, it has been embraced globally by chefs and home cooks. The umami flavor in fish sauce is due to its glutamate content.[3] Soy sauce is regarded by some in the West as a vegetarian alternative to fish sauce though they are very different in flavor.[1]:234

Fish sauce is not only added to dishes as a seasoning, but also used as a base in dipping sauces.</p>
