<h1>Yam</h1>

<p>Yam is the common name for some plant species in the genus Dioscorea (family Dioscoreaceae) that form edible tubers.[1] Yams are perennial herbaceous vines cultivated for the consumption of their starchy tubers in many temperate and tropical regions, especially in Africa, South America and the Caribbean, Asia, and Oceania.[1] The tubers themselves, also called "yams", come in a variety of forms owing to numerous cultivars and related species.[1]</p>
