<h1>Qquesadilla</h1>

<p>A quesadilla (/ˌkeɪsəˈdiːjə/; Spanish: [kesaˈðiʝa] (About this soundlisten)) is a Mexican dish and type of taco, consisting of a tortilla that is filled primarily with cheese, and sometimes meats, beans, and spices, and then cooked on a griddle. Traditionally, a corn tortilla is used, but it can also be made with a flour tortilla, particularly in northern Mexico and the United States.

A full quesadilla is made with two tortillas that hold a layer of cheese between them. A half is a single tortilla that has been filled with cheese and folded into a half-moon shape.[1][2] A quick version of the quesadilla, the cheese tortilla, is microwaved and often served to children.[3]</p>
